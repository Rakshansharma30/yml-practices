# Student Data Management (YAML)

This project loads student data from a **YAML file**, displays the list of students, and allows filtering students based on **GPA criteria**.

## Features
- Load student data from a YAML file (`students.yaml`).
- Display all student details (Name, Age, Major, GPA).
- Filter students by a minimum GPA threshold entered by the user.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyyaml` library

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-filter.git
   cd student-filter
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install pyyaml
   ```
3. **Ensure you have a valid YAML file (`students.yaml`)** in the same directory.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Program Flow**:
   - The script loads `students.yaml`.
   - Displays all students.
   - Prompts the user to enter a minimum GPA.
   - Displays students with GPA **greater than or equal to** the entered value.

## File Structure
```
/student-filter
│── students.yaml       # Contains student data
│── main.py             # Python script to process students
│── README.md           # Documentation
```

## Example `students.yaml` File
```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7
```

## Notes
- Ensure **`students.yaml` exists** before running the script.
- The script will **prompt for GPA input**, so enter a **valid number** (e.g., `3.5`).
- If no students match the filter, it will display `"No students found."`
